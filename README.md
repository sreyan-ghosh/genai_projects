# GenAI Projects

- playing_with_llms.ipynb: contains communicating with LLMs hosted on huggingface using the `requests` library using simple `POST` requests.

- vector_db_exp.ipynb: Here we will try to leverage the Cohere Embeddings generator to create our embeddings and then use Pinecone to store the vectors before using the Cohere API again to create a QA on a PDF file that we have chosen to be our source data.
